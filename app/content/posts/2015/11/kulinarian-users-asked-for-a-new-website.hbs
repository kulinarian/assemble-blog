The original version of [Kulinarian.com]({{ appUrl }}) was built by a software developer who was clueless about design (that would be me). So I worked with a professional UX designer and artist to give Kulinarians a beautifully designed website and experience. We hope you like it.

Next, we totally rebuilt the [Recipe Editing](https://www.kulinarian.com/recipe/upload) tool. Kulinarians did not like our existing tool. They felt it was to complex and it had to many editing fields that made the process feel clunky and slow. So to fix this issue, we dramatically simplified the editor to allow users to enter their recipe ingredients and steps into only two separate fields, which is a huge improvement over the previous editor’s countless inputs.

We did the same with our recipe tagging input fields. We tried to make the tag editing methods much simpler and easier to understand.

Another big feature we’re proud of is our brand new [recipe search engine](https://www.kulinarian.com/recipe/search?q=carrots). We completely rebuilt our search feature to do a better job of helping you find recipes by keywords, ingredients, and tags.

Recipe ratings were another confusing feature for our website. So we did what we should have done in the first place, which is create a simple five star rating system that users would be familiar with.  We still use our advanced algorithms on the backend to ensure the best recipes are shown first, but all of that is now hidden from the users and replaced with the 5 star system everyone knows and loves.

We also upgraded the “Menu” tool to make it easier to organize your recipes into “Menus” or collections.

So let us know what you think about the new site and keep an eye out for more new features coming soon.
