</div>

The first choice everyone comes across is Wordpress. Wordpress is by far the leader in open source and hosted website solutions. However, because of it’s vast sea of plugins, themes, and widgets, it can also be the most complex and overwhelming platform.

Squarespace has become very popular over the last few years. What it lacks in customizations - when compared to Wordpress - it makes up for in simplicity and ease of use. It’s interface and post editor are effortless to use and Squarespace allows food bloggers to focus on what they do best… write about food.

Squarespace and Wordpress are both excellent choices and hard to beat, so I wrote this quick comparison based on my experiences with using both systems.

**Consider These Options When Choosing Between The Two**

### Wordpress

If you have the skills and you’re interested in writing your own HTML, CSS, and PHP code, then Wordpress is the obvious choice for you. Because Wordpress is an “open source” codebase and written in PHP and MySQL, it offers endless possibilities, which explains why it’s the #1 website CMS in existence.

<div style="float:right;margin:0 0 0 10px;max-width:120px;">
    ![Recipe Builder]({{ assetCdn 'images/blog/2016/02/wp-logo.png' }} 'wordpress')
</div>

Also, if you have the budget, and If you need a more complex Wordpress solution, it is very easy to hire freelancers or contractors to build your Wordpress site for you.

Because Wordpress offers endless customization and complexity, it has a much steeper learning curve than Squarespace. But again, if you can take on the challenge of learning Wordpress, it will offer you the most flexibility possible.

### Wordpress Food Blogging

The Wordpress community has built many recipe and food blogging tools. You can search for [Recipe Plugins](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?type=term&q=recipes) or [Food Blog Themes](https://wordpress.org/themes/search/food%20blog/) to see the available options. These plugins and themes are awesome, but again, you will probably need to have some HTML, CSS, and PHP skills to use them.

Wordpress has nearly endless options for recipe and food writers, but those options do require that you understand some aspects of web development.

### Squarespace

Simply put, Squarespace is much easier to learn and use than Wordpress. However, because of Squarespace’s simplicity, it also means there are less options and dynamic ways to customize your website.

<div style="float:right;margin:0 0 0 10px;max-width:150px;">
    ![Recipe Builder]({{ assetCdn 'images/blog/2016/02/squarespace-logo.jpg' }} 'Squarespace')
</div>

As a food blogger, your primary needs will probably be writing cooking related blog posts, displaying awesome pictures in those posts, and then showing your post’s recipe in a concise “recipe card” style layout.

Squarespace is awesome for writing content and displaying pictures. But displaying a recipe card takes an extra step, which is described below.

Squarespace also handles your domain purchasing, hosting fees, and mobile compatibility for a low monthly fee. Wordpress on the other hand requires that you purchase domains and sort out the web hosting on your own.

### Squarespace Food Blogging

The only Squarespace recipe plugin that we’re aware of is our own [Squarespace Recipe Plugin](https://www.kulinarian.com/help/recipe-embed-square-space). So we are obviously quite biased in this section of the review. With Squarespace, you do have the option to edit CSS, and it is possible to develop a nice “recipe card” layout on your own. However, from what I can tell, dynamic features like a recipe servings & unit calculator and a recipe print button are nearly impossible without access to more sophisticated resources like a database.

The Kulinarian [Recipe Plugin](https://www.kulinarian.com/help/recipe-embed-square-space) does provide a recipe servings & unit conversions and a print button. Again, we’re self promoting here and being biased :-)

Also, Squarespace does have very nice food blog themes, but those themes do not offer servings and unit conversion tools.

**One quick Squarespace note**

You may have come across Squarespace’s help section called [Creating a recipe or content index](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206544057). Squarespace “recipes” are not necessarily meant for food bloggers and food recipes.  It’s simply a feature to help you group general blog posts into similar categories.

### How Do You Want To Spend Your Time?

The primary question you need to ask yourself is how do you want to spend your time as a food blogger or recipe writer.

You need to decide what web-development skills you have and what is most important to you as a website manager. Here is a simple breakdown of your options;

**Website #1 Options**

1. Do you want to write food and recipe content?
2. Do you want to post and share food pictures?
3. Can you write HTML, CSS, and PHP code?
4. Do you want to build your own highly customized recipe website?

If you answered yes to the questions above, then **choose Wordpress**.

**Website #2 Options**

1. Do you want to write food and recipe content?
2. Do you want to post and share food pictures?
3. Do you **NOT** want to write HTML, CSS, and PHP code?
4. Are you happy with a simple website that’s easy to manage?

If you answered yes to the second set of bullet points, then **choosing Squarespace** is the right choice for you.

And once again, we’re proud of our [Recipe Plugin](https://www.kulinarian.com/help/recipe-embed-square-space), so we promote it as much as possible. If you have questions about our plugin or need additional recipe features to suit your needs, please contact us at [info@kulinarian.com](info@kulinarian.com). 

Best of luck with your food blog,

Nate
